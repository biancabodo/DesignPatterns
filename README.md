- This program can be used for drawing certain shapes and colour them using a Java class. A Painter class is also created, in order to name the person doing the sketch. A Colour interface is created for the colouring of the shape, which is implemented in the actual colour's class, in this case Yellow. By extending the Shape class, the particular shape can be created and the method draw() is now defined. When using the Main class, a painter is identified and the methods are called in order to carry out the sketch.
