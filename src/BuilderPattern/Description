This project focuses on creating a pattern which handles orders for a local smoothie bar. It has a public class named Smoothie which handles all its subclasses, such as SmoothieMaker and its parameters, which makes the smoothie at the end by defining a method called build() and calling it in the main file. By setting some mandatory ingredients, such as the customer's name and the order requested, optional ingredients such as vegetables and a boolean parameter, in this case the addition of protein to the drink, the program is free to build a smoothie for an existing customer in the main file.
